## 📱 About

Flutter LabelScan is a mobile application that helps shoppers keep track of their shopping cart costs in real-time. Using your phone's camera, simply scan price labels while shopping, and the app will maintain a running total of your expenses, including subtotal, taxes, and final cost.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Price Scanning**: Use your camera to scan price labels on products
- **AI-powered OCR Technology**: Automatically extracts price data from scanned labels using Google Vision & Gemini API
- **Running Totals**: Keeps track of subtotal as you shop
- **Tax Calculation**: Automatically calculates taxes based on your location
- **Shopping History**: Save and review past shopping trips
- **Offline Mode**: Works without internet connection for basic functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 2.0 or higher)
- Python 3.7+ (for backend)
- Android Studio / Xcode for mobile deployment
- Camera-enabled mobile device for testing

   ```bash
   cd flutter-labelscan
   ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up the Python Flask backend
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask server locally (in development mode)
   ```bash
   export FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_DEBUG=1 && pip3 install -r ./api/requirements.txt && python3 -m flask --app api/app:create_app run --reload -p 5328
