# Active Context: Flutter LabelScan

*Updated: 4/2/2025, 3:23 AM (America/Chicago)*

## 1. Current Focus

*   Updating the project's Memory Bank files (`techContext.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `projectbrief.md`, `progress.md`).
*   **Goal:** Ensure all Memory Bank files accurately reflect the current project state, technologies, goals, and progress.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   Read `pubspec.yaml` and ran `flutter --version` to gather technical details.
*   Updated `techContext.md` with Flutter/Dart versions, dependencies (Firebase, camera, http, etc.), IDE (VS Code), inferred State Management (`setState`), and Navigation (`Navigator`).
*   Read `README.md` (provided by user) to understand the project's purpose.
*   Updated `productContext.md` with the problem statement (tracking shopping costs) and solution (real-time label scanning and cost calculation).
*   Identified `setState` and `Navigator` usage via code search (`search_files`).

## 3. Next Steps

*   [List the next 1-3 concrete actions to be taken.]
    1.  Read and update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
    2.  Read and update `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
    3.  Read and update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
    4.  Ask user for remaining details needed for `techContext.md` (Code Style, Commit Messages, Branching Strategy, Testing).

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

*   Need clarification on Code Style, Commit Message convention, Branching Strategy, and Integration Testing usage for `techContext.md`.
*   Need to confirm the specific OCR technology used (Google ML Kit or Tesseract, as mentioned in README).
*   Need details for `projectbrief.md` and `progress.md`.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Learnings)

*   **Memory Bank:** Strict adherence to maintaining the Memory Bank is crucial. All core files must exist and be updated regularly.
*   **Initial Setup:** The current focus is on establishing the foundational documentation before significant coding begins.

## 6. Project Insights

*   [Any high-level observations or learnings about the project so far.]
