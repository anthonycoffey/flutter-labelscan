# Project Progress: Flutter LabelScan

*Updated: 4/16/2025, 3:00 AM (America/Chicago)*

## 1. Current Status

*   **Overall:** Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated following the addition of the "Clear All Lists" button to the `SavedListsScreen` AppBar. Ready for next feature development phase or addressing outstanding questions.
*   **Completed Features:**
    *   Memory Bank directory and core file templates created and populated with initial project context.
    *   **Saved Lists Feature:**
        *   Implemented using Firestore.
        *   Users can view a list of their saved label lists.
        *   Users can view the contents of a specific saved list.
        *   Users can delete saved lists (using `flutter_slidable`).
    *   **Image Picker Integration:**
        *   Added avatar upload functionality to the "My Account" page.
        *   Added label image upload/scan functionality to the "Home" screen (facilitates testing).
    *   **Memory Bank Update (4/6/2025):**
        *   Reviewed all core Memory Bank files.
        *   Verified dependencies via `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   Corrected state management details in `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` (Riverpod/Provider).
        *   Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect the review process.
    *   **List Details UI Refinement (4/15/2025):**
        *   Updated `list_details_screen.dart` to show calculated tax percentage (e.g., "Taxes (8.25%)").
        *   Removed colons from Subtotal, Taxes, and Total labels on the same screen.
    *   **HomeScreen AppBar UI Update (4/16/2025):**
        *   Modified `home_screen.dart` to replace the `PopupMenuButton` with direct `IconButton`s for "Save List" and "Clear All Items" in the `AppBar`.
        *   Added conditional color-coding: Save button is green when active, Clear button is red when active.
    *   **SavedListsScreen AppBar UI Update (4/16/2025):**
        *   Modified `saved_lists_screen.dart` to add a red "Clear All Lists" `IconButton` (`Icons.delete_forever_outlined`) to the `AppBar` actions, triggering the existing `_deleteAllLists` function.
*   **In-Progress Features:**
    *   (None currently active)
*   **Upcoming Features:**
    *   Enhancing toolbar for branding (e.g., logo placement, colors).
    *   Implementation of remaining core UI screens (e.g., detailed Camera screen if different from home scan).
    *   Integration with Flask backend API for OCR.
    *   Implementation of the core scanning and calculation logic.
    *   Testing (Unit, Widget, potentially Integration).

## 2. What Works

*   Basic Flutter project structure exists with core dependencies identified (`pubspec.yaml`).
*   Memory Bank files are updated and reflect the current understanding of the project.
*   Key technologies (Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Riverpod/Provider, Python/Flask backend) are identified.
*   Core application flow (Auth -> Scan -> Calculate) is documented.
*   Saved Lists feature (view, detail, delete) using Firestore.
*   Image picking for avatar and label input.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Define

*   **Memory Bank Refinement (Requires User Input):**
    *   `techContext.md`: Clarify Commit Message convention. Confirm Branching Strategy (Feature Branch vs. Trunk-based - assumed Feature Branch for now).
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Define specific Error Handling strategy. (Backend OCR confirmed as Google Cloud Vision/Gemini API).
    *   `projectbrief.md`: Define "Out of Scope" items, Success Metrics.
*   **Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   Backend API implementation (Flask OCR endpoint).
    *   Frontend integration with the backend API.
    *   Detailed implementation of the label scanning and price calculation logic.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Toolbar branding, Home screen interactivity improvements.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, widget, and potentially integration tests.
*   **Platform Configuration:** Finalize permissions (Camera, Network), specific build settings.
*   **Deployment:** Setup for deploying to iOS/Android.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Requires User Input:** Need clarification on placeholders mentioned in "What's Left to Build / Define" (Commit messages, Branching, Error Handling, Out of Scope, Success Metrics).
*   **Backend Dependency:** Full functionality requires the Flask OCR backend (using Google Cloud Vision/Gemini API) to be implemented and integrated.
*   **Git Workflow Discrepancy:** Need confirmation on Feature Branch vs. Trunk-based development.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions & Learnings

*   *(Initial Entry)* The Memory Bank system was established as the primary method for maintaining project context due to Cline's memory reset characteristic.
*   *(4/3/2025)* Successfully integrated Firestore for the "Saved Lists" feature, marking the first use of Firebase database services in the project. Implemented `image_picker` for user profile avatars and home screen label input, improving usability and testing capabilities.
*   *(4/4/2025)* Updated app branding (name, icons) across platforms. Refined UI by removing the divider on the list details screen. Updated Memory Bank files (`techContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on recent git history and conversation.
*   *(4/6/2025)* Completed a full review and update of all core Memory Bank files. Corrected state management documentation (Riverpod/Provider) based on `pubspec.yaml`. Identified minor discrepancies (e.g., Git workflow) for future clarification. Removed unexpected leading text from `progress.md`.
*   *(4/15/2025)* Refined the saved list details screen (`list_details_screen.dart`) to display the calculated tax percentage and removed colons from footer labels for a cleaner receipt look. Updated Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   *(4/16/2025)* Updated the `HomeScreen` AppBar by removing the hamburger menu (`PopupMenuButton`) and adding direct `IconButton`s for Save and Clear actions, improving accessibility. Added color-coding (green for save, red for clear) to these buttons when active. Added a "Clear All Lists" button to the `SavedListsScreen` AppBar. Updated Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
