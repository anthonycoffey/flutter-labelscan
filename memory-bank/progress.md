# Project Progress: Flutter LabelScan

*Updated: 4/2/2025, 3:24 AM (America/Chicago)*

## 1. Current Status

*   **Overall:** Memory Bank population phase largely complete based on available information and inference. Ready to clarify remaining unknowns.
*   **Completed Features:**
    *   Memory Bank directory and core file templates created.
    *   Populated `techContext.md` with framework/language versions, dependencies, inferred state management (`setState`), navigation (`Navigator`), IDE.
    *   Populated `productContext.md` with problem statement, solution, and key features based on README.
    *   Updated `activeContext.md` with current focus, recent changes, next steps, and open questions.
    *   Populated `systemPatterns.md` with client-server architecture details, identified patterns (setState, Navigator, async/await, Future/StreamBuilder), data handling (Firebase, http), and scanning flow overview.
    *   Populated `projectbrief.md` with project goals, core requirements, initial scope, and target audience based on README.
*   **In-Progress Features:**
    *   Finalizing Memory Bank updates (requires user input for remaining placeholders).
*   **Upcoming Features:**
    *   Implementation of core UI screens (Auth, Home, Camera).
    *   Integration with Firebase Auth and Firestore.
    *   Integration with Flask backend API for OCR.
    *   Implementation of the scanning and calculation logic.
    *   Testing (Unit, Widget, potentially Integration).

## 2. What Works

*   Basic Flutter project structure exists with core dependencies identified (`pubspec.yaml`).
*   Memory Bank files are populated with current understanding of the project.
*   Key technologies (Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Python/Flask backend) are identified.
*   Core application flow (Auth -> Scan -> Calculate) is documented.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Define

*   **Memory Bank Finalization:**
    *   `techContext.md`: Code Style, Commit Message convention, Branching Strategy, Integration Testing usage.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Specific Error Handling strategy, confirmation of backend OCR library (ML Kit/Tesseract).
    *   `projectbrief.md`: Definition of "Out of Scope" items, Success Metrics.
    *   `progress.md`: Refine based on actual implementation progress.
*   **Code Implementation:** All application code (UI screens, state logic, API calls, data models, calculations).
*   **Backend Implementation:** Flask API endpoint for OCR processing.
*   **Testing:** Writing and running tests.
*   **Platform Configuration:** Permissions (Camera, Network), specific build settings.
*   **Deployment:** Setup for deploying to iOS/Android.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Requires User Input:** Need clarification on placeholders in `techContext.md` (Code Style, Commits, Branching, Testing), `systemPatterns.md` (Error Handling, OCR lib), and `projectbrief.md` (Out of Scope, Success Metrics).

## 5. Evolution of Decisions & Learnings

*   *(Initial Entry)* The Memory Bank system was established as the primary method for maintaining project context due to Cline's memory reset characteristic.
