# Project Progress: Flutter LabelScan

*Updated: 4/3/2025, 8:16 PM (America/Chicago)*

## 1. Current Status

*   **Overall:** Core Memory Bank established. Initial features implemented, including Firestore integration for saved lists and image picking capabilities. Ready for next feature development phase.
*   **Completed Features:**
    *   Memory Bank directory and core file templates created and populated with initial project context.
    *   **Saved Lists Feature:**
        *   Implemented using Firestore.
        *   Users can view a list of their saved label lists.
        *   Users can view the contents of a specific saved list.
        *   Users can delete saved lists.
    *   **Image Picker Integration:**
        *   Added avatar upload functionality to the "My Account" page.
        *   Added label image upload/scan functionality to the "Home" screen (facilitates testing).
*   **In-Progress Features:**
    *   (None currently active, pending next feature cycle)
*   **Upcoming Features:**
    *   Enhancing toolbar for branding.
    *   Improving interactivity on the "Home" screen (Save List/Clear List buttons, potentially with jump menu/labels).
    *   Implementation of remaining core UI screens (e.g., detailed Camera screen if different from home scan).
    *   Integration with Flask backend API for OCR.
    *   Implementation of the core scanning and calculation logic.
    *   Testing (Unit, Widget, potentially Integration).

## 2. What Works

*   Basic Flutter project structure exists with core dependencies identified (`pubspec.yaml`).
*   Memory Bank files are populated with current understanding of the project.
*   Key technologies (Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Python/Flask backend) are identified.
*   Core application flow (Auth -> Scan -> Calculate) is documented.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Define

*   **Memory Bank Refinement:**
    *   `techContext.md`: Clarify Code Style, Commit Message convention, Branching Strategy, Integration Testing usage.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Define specific Error Handling strategy, confirm backend OCR library (ML Kit/Tesseract).
    *   `projectbrief.md`: Define "Out of Scope" items, Success Metrics.
*   **Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   Backend API implementation (Flask OCR endpoint).
    *   Frontend integration with the backend API.
    *   Detailed implementation of the label scanning and nutritional calculation logic.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Toolbar branding, Home screen interactivity improvements.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, widget, and potentially integration tests.
*   **Platform Configuration:** Finalize permissions (Camera, Network), specific build settings.
*   **Deployment:** Setup for deploying to iOS/Android.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Requires User Input:** Need clarification on placeholders in `techContext.md` (Code Style, Commits, Branching, Testing), `systemPatterns.md` (Error Handling, OCR lib), and `projectbrief.md` (Out of Scope, Success Metrics).
*   **Backend Dependency:** Full functionality requires the Flask OCR backend to be implemented and integrated.

## 5. Evolution of Decisions & Learnings

*   *(Initial Entry)* The Memory Bank system was established as the primary method for maintaining project context due to Cline's memory reset characteristic.
*   *(4/3/2025)* Successfully integrated Firestore for the "Saved Lists" feature, marking the first use of Firebase database services in the project. Implemented `image_picker` for user profile avatars and home screen label input, improving usability and testing capabilities.
